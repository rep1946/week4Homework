## Weather Application!!!

Now it's time for you to build out a complete application from scratch. 

### Your application should:

1. Allow user to type in temperature in Celsius
2. User can click a button and have the temperature appear converted into Farenheit
3. If the temperature is above 60 degrees Farenheit, the background should be red
4. If the background image is between 30 and 60 degrees Farenheit, the background should be grey 
5. If the background image is below 30 degrees Farenheit, the background should be blue

**BONUS**: Instead of straight up colors, use background images!

### A little hint of pseudocode:

- When the button is clicked
    - We grab the input from the DOM
    - And use the `.value` property to get the temperature
    - And then do.... something......... ðŸ¤”


### What you'll need to make:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `main.js`
